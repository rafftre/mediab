# Media B

Webapp to show the average points of the Italian *Serie B* soccer league - for the season 2018-19.
That season had an odd number of teams - 19 - with many games played at different times than the scheduled round and with several teams having point penalties.
Since the standings by average points were not easily visible on any Italian media, I used this application to have the actual standings available at all times.

**This web application was developed in fall 2018**

Initially the application was structured in a Python backend and an AngularJS frontend, then I used only the frontend. The _api_ folder is the backend while the _webapp_ folder is the frontend.


## Notes

Standings data are provided by an external service.

_Media_ in Italian means average.
